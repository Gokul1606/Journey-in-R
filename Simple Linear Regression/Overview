Simple Linear Regression on Auto Dataset
This project uses simple linear regression techniques to analyze the Auto dataset. The analysis focuses on examining the relationships between mpg (miles per gallon) and 
other key variables such as horsepower, weight, and acceleration.

Project Overview
Correlation Analysis:Calculate the correlation between mpg and other variables (horsepower, weight, and acceleration) to understand the strength and direction of their relationships.

Scatter Plots:
Visualize the relationships between mpg and other variables using scatter plots.
Include both scatter plots with and without confidence intervals (CI) to highlight trends and variability.

Simple Linear Regression Models:

Build linear regression models to predict mpg based on:
Horsepower
Weight
Use the models to interpret the impact of an increase in horsepower or weight on mpg.
Predictions:

Predict mpg for specific car attributes, such as:
A car with 190 horsepower
A car weighing 4000 lbs

Key Objectives
Understand the relationships between mpg and other important automotive variables.
Use regression models to predict mpg based on given horsepower and weight values.
Interpret the correlations and regression results to identify patterns in the dataset.
