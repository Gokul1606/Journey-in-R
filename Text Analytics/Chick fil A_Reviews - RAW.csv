This was my first time trying chick-fil-a and believing the hype I was anticipating some amazing chicken sandwich’s. I had ordered the classic sandwich and a deluxe sandwich with waffle fries. Both sandwich buns were soggy and oily. The classic sandwich was literally two pieces of bread with a chicken tender stuffed in the middle, and two single slices of pickle as if their was a shortage on pickles. The chicken itself was crispy but dry.The waffle fries were the only decent thing if you dunked them in the chick-fil-a sauce.For the price your paying a junior chicken from McDonald’s would be a better choice then what I had got from this establishment . Would not recommend the wait time for these sandwich’s"

We ordered Chicken soup noodle which hardly had any chicken.I specially ordered the soup as I loved it last time. My husband ordered spicy chicken delux, the chicken size was smaller than last time.

Mcdonald’s is honestly better. Not sure why people go crazy over this place. literally got a piece of chicken on bread with two pickles. no sauce or anything, is this a joke?

It's a very different experience then you would receive in the US where they have somebody taking your order physically even though they have the speaker systems, they also we're unable to handle the flow with no cars in line, where in the US they have to good coming out like a well-oiled machine. I'm just glad I wasn't in the lineup that formed behind us, or we would be waiting an additional 25 minutes on the 15 that we had to wait. So as we were directed off to park and wait for our food, when I arrive 10 minutes later wasn't even our food. When they gave us the cracked food they didn't give us anything to drink or drinks with, so we had to wait an additional 5 minutes for straws to be brought out.

It makes me sad because Chick-fil-A being my favorite, I won't be visiting this one again.

The only positive thing out of this adventure, what's my spicy chicken strips (gosh darn those are good) the waffle fries were undercooked and kind of soggy to be honest."

(My 2nd time ordering because 1st time they ran out of items: grilled chicken and I had to go back the week afterwards for my discounted grilled chicken meal.)

As you can see the menu, which was given to me tonight, (see all 5 pictures I posted) does not even have the correct prices! Why offer me something with all the wrong prices and no list of sauce choices! ***You need to know when you order what sauces you would like!

They do NOT have Gluten Free Buns and can't lettuce wrap your sandwich with more than a leaf of lettuce and charge you extra for extra lettuce. WHERE was this extra lettuce, may I ask?!

Be forewarned, if you order a lemonade, it will come half filled with ice! And then, you will be charged an extra 50 cent on your meal combo for this half lemonaid filled cup! Once home, ice diluted my drink.

As you can see I was not informed of such upcharges on my order tonight.

Called to talk to manager and Ekon could not find a quiet place to talk and could barely hear me! They verified the price as being correct and appologized about it being wrong without offering a future correction for THEIR misinformation provided to us customers!

I guess I need to go in person to get some corrective action on their behalf.

On a plus note, chick fil a sauce and honey bbq sauce were worth the try! Fries are a different surprise! 🤗 And their Sweet tea brings me back to some sweet memories of TN!

If I will be back to eat, leaves me in a pondering mood. I will update after going in person next week, because they are closed Sundays.

This was my literal first impression. It’s an American chain that only recently came to Canada.

I got the basic chicken sandwich with the waffle fries as take out. The bun was slightly toasted, but was a little soggy in the foil bag after the 12 minute drive home. The breaded fillet was a good size and seems like it was cut and not formed like some other chicken “patties”. It comes with pickles, but I was half done before I got any. They only put 2 tiny pickles on. The Buffalo sauce was my choice and it was good. All in all, the sandwich was good, but many other fast food places have as good or better, in my opinion.

The waffle fries are good. Some of them weren’t cut right though and you get a chunk of potato. They were well cooked and seasoned.

The price was reasonable. I don’t eat much fast food and it’s not my typical review. It’s still fairly new to Kitchener and now, at least I gave it a try. I personally think that A&W does a better chicken sandwich, but it’s $3 more."

First off... the lemade was fantastic; 10/10 hearty, pulpy, and semi sweet, but the milkshake was average, at best. 5/10

Waffle fries were warm and hearty. 7/10 on these certainly.

For a restaurant that is almost ENTIRELY  based around chicken served on a bun, one might expect a warm toasted bun and a piping hot chicken filet and warm bacon.  None of that here!  The marinaded filet was tasty, to be honest, but after sending the first one back because it was FRIGID, and asking for a warm meal, I gave 'em a chance to live up to the fanfare.

I also like how they have table service once you order at the counter.

Here's a tip, they give free refills if you go back up to the counter and request this.

The only thing that I found strange was that they had combination codes on the bathrooms. You'll find the combination code on the bottom of your receipt, so be prepared to either memorize the number or bring your receipt with you!

The chicken was tasty and you've got to request the Chick-fil-A sauce for dipping. It is a unique taste and one that should be tried at least once."

OMG! Let's turn around! - That is exactly what we thought when we reached to this location couple of days ago on Saturday evening. The drive through line-up was really long and the in-store line-up was reaching out the main doors.

However, we decided to get into the in-store line-up. I am not sure what's the wait time on drive through, but reading the other reviews, it surely is pretty high.

As you might have guessed by now, for us it was really fast! We didn't think we would be in and out just under 15 mins! Yes!

Kudos to the team of this location and the location manager!!!! They are doing an amazing job in turning around the orders.

Going into more details:
1. Ample parking as they are part of a plaza.
2. Handicapped accessible entrance available!!!
3. NO Dine-in or patio, at least definitely not on a Saturday when we went there.
4. COVID measures followed to the ""T""s.
5. Amazing staff, very helpful and humble!!!
6. Interesting drink options for the first timers for sure.
7. Amazing range of sauces with no extra cost!!!

So, you must be thinking why not 5 stars???

Here you go with the comments on food:
1. We ordered 3 sandwiches - spicy chicken, their standard and grilled. We only liked spicy one, it was juicy, well cooked and tender. However, the other 2 were really dry and hence, you need the sauces, especially the grilled one. Highly recommend spicy, the other 2, worth 1 shot max.

2. We ordered both kinds of nuggets. Loved the normal nuggets, super juicy, very tasty and right amount of spice level. In other words - Perfect!!!. However, once again disappointed with grilled ones, dry and no spice at all!!!

3. Drink - peach milkshake - really awesome. Could be too sweet if you are not into sweet stuff a lot.

4. Sauces - really like their own and sweet n spicy one. Didn't like others a lot. However, choice of sauces vary from person to person.

They lost one star due to the quality of food and the portion. OMG! Do not go there if ur super hungry, else order at least 2 sandwiches with all the sauces (no cost, u would love some of them) and 1 drink.

Now my fav part of the order - the turn around time. This is true guys, they are really good at what they do. They take orders upfront and then u have to just pick up. They have 3 people taking orders simultaneously!!! And 4 cash registers working at the same time and hence amazing turn around time!!!
On top of that - I literally ordered 1 sandwiche and 1 nuggets box at the time when I was at cash register. Thought now I would have to wait for another 15 mins so that they prepare the last minute request. I was surprised they did that in less than 2 mins!!!! I checked all the items if they missed any and they didn't!!!

The sandwich hype kinda made me expect more, so It was okayishly good for me. The buns were legit soft and chicken was tender. I would rate it 4/5. I was drooling over the grilled nuggets. I strongly recommend those. The best ever nuggets. Fries were usual just the shape was different. The spicy strips were above average and there is a room of improvement there.
We legit ordered every sauce. Sweet and spicy sriracha, Chick-fil-A and Polynesian went very well with the grilled nuggets. Honey mustard and barbecue went well with the spicy chicken strips. I did not like the zesty buffalo.

The queues are massive and expect to wait over 1 hour before your turn comes up."

My experiences at Chick-Fil-A in the past hadn't exactly wowed me, to be honest. There was this one time where a female employee gave me an eye roll as I took my time with the menu, and another occasion where I felt like I was being shooed out the door before I could even blink because i took some time ordering. Being a senior citizen, It's important i have some time the menu, but it seemed like I was always being hurried through the ordering process.
But, hey, I'm all about second chances! So, a few Tuesdays ago, I rolled through the drive-thru for one last shot. And guess what? The service this time around was nothing short of splendid. Jonah, the employee who took my order, was an absolute gem. He greeted me with such positivity, patience, and even took the time to answer all my menu-related questions. Not once did I feel like he was rushing me, and his friendly demeanor really put a smile on my face. I did however get the wrong sandwich by the people on the inside. When I realized my sandwich was wrong, I swung back around to the drive-thru again. Another employee named Micah was there to save the day. He listened to my concerns with genuine understanding, spoke with such eloquence, and boy, did he know his stuff! He even gave me his word that the issue would be fixed, and true to his promise, it was. He turned what could've been a sour situation into a surprisingly positive experience. Honestly, in all my years, I've never encountered customer service quite like what I experienced that day with these two gentlemen. So, please, pass on my heartfelt thanks to these two because they've saved you a customer. Great job, Chick-Fil-A!"

I got a cookie as compensation. 🍪-Not exactly the same as a salad.(I’m allergic to milk) Overall I would still consider coming back once in awhile it’s got some good stuff. The watermelon 🍉  iced tea drink is 10/10 ⭐️⭐️please keep it forever!!!!! I’ll change my review to 5 stars if it’s sticks around☺️"

It's like a big thing !
And when we went there, it was all packed up with people dining in and driving through its busier than McDonald's !

Well, regarding their chicken burger ...
Nothing wow! , but not bad
Nothing specific about it
It's not a big deal, sorry, at least to me!
Their waffle fries are somehow good

I believe the KFC crunchy sandwich or Popeyes chicken sandwich is a little better than this!
I will not drive 40 min again for it!

Wish you guys the best."

They've got a reputation for exceptional service and being super kid-friendly, and they sure lived up to it. Right from the get-go, a server, Irisha, came over to our table, introduced herself, and gave a friendly ""hi"" to my little ones. That's the kind of kid-friendliness you want to see.

Speaking of my toddlers, Irisha made sure we didn't have to keep running up to the counter. She was on top of things, making sure we were comfy the whole time. Plus, she even took the time to clean the high chairs before handing them over. That's a level of cleanliness you'd expect from a fancy 5-star restaurant, not a fast-food joint.
While we waited for our food, Irisha struck up a friendly chat with us. She even cracked a joke that had us all chuckling. It's not often you find yourself having a good laugh in a fast-food place, right? The staff was really happy and cheerful. I could see they loved working there. Its not just the guest but the interaction of the staff with eachother is so much funn. They are always smiling. Way to go Chick-fil- A
Now, onto the food. We ordered a Spicy Deluxe meal, their regular chicken sandwich, and two kids' nugget combos. The only downside was those fries – they were seriously salty, even for the little ones. But oh boy, that chicken! It was so juicy and tasty, it made up for the salty fries.

So, all in all, Chick-fil-A felt more like a high-class restaurant than your typical fast-food joint. Thanks to chick-fil- a  members for exceptional experience. Eh, we left with full bellies and smiles, ready to come back for more of that juicy goodness"

To the managers.  Waffle fries are amazing, however.....they need to be more well done.  Please don't remove them from the fryers until they are done.  We waited 20 minutes for our order.  I'd wait another few minutes for the fries.  It was a shame.  Everyone is amazing.  In this heat and humidity, good for them.  Thanks for the fans for the outside greeters, that was nice.

I wasn’t a fan of the waffle fries they weren’t hot and kinda dry and soggy. The nuggets weren’t bad but for almost $14 I’d expect just more.

I will say all new restaurants have growing pains and chick-fil-a is no exception especially when they opened they weren’t really allowed to have people inside. It’s only been a year for this location it typically takes 5 years to settle and get the kinks worked out. Give it time.

Also I’ve seen concerns about peanut oil being used and no allergy warnings. An allergy to peanuts typically means you can have products cooked in/with peanut oil the two are not mutually exclusive in terms of being allergic to them you can be allergic to peanuts or peanut oil or both of them but that’s considered kind of rare. They are two completely different allergies."

The menu is very simple with very few items to choose from.

The food in general is good,  not excellent . The Chicken is tender, it's perfectly breaded not overly done.  The chic Fila sauce is based on  mc Donald's mac sauce instead of relish in the recipe  they add honey .
How does it compare to  KFC , popeyes, Jollibee and Mary browns .
Not as greasy as KFC, not as dry as popeyes , not as plain as Jollibee,  not as much breading as Mary browns .
Popeyes has good fries , KFC breading/ skin has lots of salty flavor,  Jollibee good if u like plain food. Mary browns has perfectly seasoned breading.

We tried the kids' meal, which my child absolutely loved. It was just the right size and healthy too, making it a great option for young diners. We also attended their ""Adopt a Cow"" event, which turned out to be a blast. The event was well-organized, fun, and educational, providing an enjoyable activity for children.

One of the highlights of our visit was definitely the potato fries. They were super crispy and had a fun waffle shape that added an extra element of enjoyment to the meal. Additionally, this place offers a great selection of chicken sandwiches, all made with high-quality ingredients and really tasty. Each bite was delicious and satisfying.

It’s worth noting that it does get pretty crowded in the evenings. Despite the crowd, the staff are always friendly and efficient, ensuring that the service remains top-notch. The busy atmosphere is a testament to the popularity of the place and the quality of the food they serve.

Overall, this fast-food spot is an excellent choice for a family meal. The engaging events, delicious food, and friendly service make it a go-to destination for both kids and adults. Whether you're stopping by for a quick meal or attending one of their fun events, you're sure to have a great time."

There are only a few Chick-fil-A locations in Canada, mostly in Toronto, but I believe this Kitchener location is one of the original ones.

Their chicken burgers are delicious, especially the spicy one. The sauces are yummy—definitely try them all and find your favourite. 😉 Their waffle fries were a highlight (my daughter loved them!❣️)—crispy on the outside and soft inside, just like you’d hope for. Everything was served quickly, even though it was busy.

This turned out to be a fantastic choice! We all absolutely loved the food, and I must say, Chick-fil-A exceeded our expectations in every way.

First and foremost, the chicken sandwich was simply outstanding. The chicken was perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy, with a delightful crispy coating that made every bite a pleasure. We've tried chicken sandwiches at various places, but Chick-fil-A's version truly stands out as the best we've had so far.
The waffle potatoes were another highlight of our meal. They were perfectly seasoned and crispy on the outside, while soft and fluffy on the inside. These waffle fries were so addictive that we couldn't stop munching on them throughout our meal.

We also decided to try their milkshake, and it was the perfect sweet treat to round off our meal. It was creamy, rich, and full of flavor, making it an ideal complement to the savory items we ordered.

One thing that puzzled us, though, was the connection of cows with Chick-fil-A. We saw a lot of cow-themed marketing materials and slogans like ""Eat Mor Chikin,"" which we found amusing but slightly confusing. After a quick search, we learned that Chick-fil-A uses cows in their advertising to humorously encourage people to eat chicken instead of beef. This clever and quirky marketing strategy definitely added to the charm of our experience.

Overall, our visit to Chick-fil-A in Kitchener was delightful. The food quality, friendly staff, and unique marketing made it a memorable dining experience. We highly recommend trying their chicken sandwich, waffle fries, and milkshake if you haven't already. We can't wait to return for another delicious meal!"

It is not like your typical fast food “restaurant” (aka. takeout place) at all. We were served quickly because there was plenty of staff. The pricing was akin to McDonald’s but the quality of the food was significantly better. The staff brought the food right to our table. While we were waiting, a Tuesday night bingo game begun and many people in the restaurant participated. A man in a cow mascot costume walked around the restaurant for a while - much to the delight of my 1 year old. The manager saw how happy the cow mascot made my toddler, so she gave her a little cow plushie to take home. What we thought would be a quick stop in for food turned into a really memorable experience. We will definitely be back!"

They have cherry coke! and some tea with lemonade which is a nice option as well. The sauces they have are delicious, try them all and choose your favorite!

To further impress, the speed of service!
We sat down and not even 30 seconds later, our food had arrived.
The food was hot and fresh, with the taste that will blow your taste buds away!
The restaurant itself was clean and well maintained. To top off such an excellent experience,  I noticed on my bill that my price was reduced when I removed the ingredients I did not like.

Drive through line was wrapped around the cinema, and even at that, it was only a 20 minute wait.

The nuggets and chicken strips are much smaller than what you expect at a fast food place. That said, it’s better. Just keep your expectations in check.

The Chick-fil-A Deluxe sandwich was perfect. All white meat and juicy.

Waffle fries taste like fresh cut potatoes. Perfect.

The restaurant is conveniently located in Kitchener, right across from the CF Fairview Park Mall, making it easily accessible. As soon as I walked in, I was impressed by the spacious interior and the warm and friendly staff.

During my visit, I had the pleasure of chatting with the owner, who was incredibly friendly and passionate about providing a great dining experience. Now, let's talk about the food. The burgers at Chic-fil-A were absolutely delicious. They were cooked to perfection, juicy, and packed with flavor. But what truly stole the show for me were the waffle-shaped fries. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, they were a delightful accompaniment to the meal. And let's not forget about the honey mustard sauce, which added a tangy and savory twist to every bite.

To satisfy my sweet tooth, I couldn't resist trying their thick and creamy milkshake. It was the perfect balance of sweetness and richness, leaving me completely satisfied. What impressed me the most about Chic-fil-A was the affordability of their menu. Despite offering high-quality food, the prices were reasonable, making it an excellent choice for a satisfying meal.

Based on my experience, I highly recommend trying out Chic-fil-A. I've been here multiple times now and each visit has been consistently fantastic. I would rate them 9 out of 10, and I encourage them to keep up the good work. Whether you're a burger enthusiast or simply looking for a delicious and affordable dining option, Chic-fil-A is definitely worth a visit."

Recently, I had a coupon for a free meal and I naturally assumed it to be a simple and basic Chicken Burger, no combos, no drinks, no fries, no add-ons, just the most basic meal. I was very pleasantly surprised when I was informed that I could choose any meal on the menu and make it a combo all at no cost. The meal was so delicious and I would highly recommend the Chick-fil-A Sauce which was makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Another thing that made my time very pleasant was there was a really nice server walking around to all the tables asking if there was anything we needed and giving us free mints (which were very delicious by the way)! All in all, my experience at Chick-fil-A Kitchener was something I will never forget and I am super excited to go back whenever I can!"

★★★★- The chicken sandwich itself was tasty but I was hoping slightly bigger size of chicken.

★★★★- The waiting line was so long it was back up to the entrance door (It was the lunch peak time) but the store managed to take orders in the line to shorten the wait line.

My first time here was actually months or maybe even a year after they had opened and to my surprise the drive through was as busy as opening day. I had heard about the good things about this restaurant, specifically the excellent customer service, food and environment and know I understand why that is true. I tried their chicken sandwich and to say it was “amazing” is an understatement. It was fresh, juicy, and the bun truly glistened without the need of an oily mess. And not to mentioned it had all the good qualities that a high quality burger would have which absolutely smashes other fast food chains like McDonald’s or Burger King and even some actual restaurants. I also tried the chicken tenders and though the 4 pieces were quite small the taste takes away from that fact. I tried the chick-fil-a sauce and that was also worth the compliments people had given it as it was savoury and well balanced. I also tried their vanilla milkshake and that is how a good milkshake is supposed to taste, not to thick or sweet, and made of pure ingredients. I’ve been to a lot of restaurants in my life but if you’re in the area you need to come down and try it for yourself. Not to mention the exceptional customer service they had, realizing the lines were getting long inside the store, which was clean and good looking an employee had came up to me and started taking my order and was well educated about her menu and was friendly. Overall a truly amazing service and they definitely earned themselves a returning customer! Nice work guys!"

The chicken sandwich was really good. I also didn't realize I was missing waffle fries in my life.
The staff are much different than a regular fast food joint. They came around to the tables to ask if you needed anything. This was not out of boredom either. They were very busy. Also, they were not stingy on the sauces, which is a bonus in my books. I love my dipping sauce. Got a chick-fil-A sauce bottle for home. Great work Chick-fil-A team!"

The chicken isn't some mind blowing experience that you often read about before they finally arrived in Canada, but it's good.

The spicy chicken sandwich is good, breast is wider and thinner than competition (Popeyes/KFC/Mary Browns). To be honest, my 'Best Sandwich' rankings to be interchangeable based on whichever one was freshest the last time I had one.

Spicy Tenders were ok, more salty than spicy though. Filet sauce is good (Honey Mustard Aioli). Waffle fries aren't my preferred cut of fried potato, but I do really like these.

Fantastic beverage selection, with the usual Coke products as well as sweetened and diet versions of fresh Iced Tea and lemonade.

I ate in the restaurant and service is where they definitely set themselves apart. Staff all seemed genuinely happy to be there, and the franchise owner/operator was who brought my food to me at my seat. Twice a staff member came to my table and asked if I'd like a refill on my drink or if I needed any additional sauce.

I don't eat much 'fast food' but if I do have a craving then I'll definitely be back."
